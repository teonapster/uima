Songs for the Deaf

Songs for the Deaf is the third studio album by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age. Released on August 27, 2002, the album features Foo Fighters and former Nirvana member Dave Grohl as a guest drummer. Like their other albums, "Songs for the Deaf" has a large number of guest musicians, a signature of the band's releases. The album garnered critical acclaim, and the band earned its first gold record certification in the United States, after selling 986,000 copies. One million copies of the album were sold in Europe, earning the band a platinum certification from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) in 2008.
"Songs for the Deaf" is loosely considered a concept album, taking the listener on a drive from Los Angeles to Joshua Tree while tuning into radio stations from towns along the way, such as Banning on the song "God Is in the Radio", and Chino Hills, California.
Overview and background.
Contributors.
"Songs for the Deaf" was the first Queens of the Stone Age album that featured Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters on drums, who also toured with the band. He replaced the previous drummer, Gene Trautmann, who started working on other projects. Grohl had been a keen admirer of Queens of the Stone Age since the band opened for Foo Fighters on tour and originally wanted to appear on "Rated R". He joined Queens of the Stone Age in October 2001 when he received a phone call from Josh Homme with whom he had been friends since 1992, while Homme was the guitarist for Kyuss. Grohl admitted that he had not drummed for a long time and added that fronting a band was "tiring". Grohl put Foo Fighters on temporary hiatus, delaying their upcoming album "One by One" to October 22, 2002 because of touring duties with Queens of the Stone Age in support of the album. Grohl's first performance with the band occurred at March 7, 2002 in The Troubadour, Los Angeles, and his last performance was at the Fuji Rock Festival on 
July 28, 2002. He returned to the Foo Fighters soon after, initially being replaced by former Blinker the Star and Failure drummer Kellii Scott before Danzig drummer Joey Castillo was eventually announced as his long-term replacement in August 2002.
"Songs for the Deaf" marks the last appearances on a Queens of the Stone Age record of former members Brendon McNichol (lap steel), and Gene Trautmann (drums). The album also included the first musical contribution to a Queens of the Stone Age album by multi-instrumentalists Natasha Shneider and Alain Johannes. Jeordie White (of Marilyn Manson fame) reportedly auditioned for the band in 2002 but lost out to Troy Van Leeuwen, who joined the band as a touring member in support of "Songs for the Deaf". White did appear on the album, however, making a brief cameo appearance as a radio DJ. Shneider, Johannes, and Van Leeuwen would subsequently become full-time Queens of the Stone Age members and contribute to the follow-up album "Lullabies to Paralyze", released in 2005.
Another change in personnel came with the arrival of producer Eric Valentine, who had previously worked on a pair of Dwarves albums with Nick Oliveri. Valentine was actually a requirement by Interscope and did not do his job according to Homme, who commented that " just recorded it actually, it says production, he was only there to record the beginning of it." Valentine did sessions with the band during the initial recording period in October and November 2001, but were unhappy with his work and later re-recorded the album in spring 2002.
Rounding out the lineup was singer/songwriter Mark Lanegan, formerly of Screaming Trees, a band that Homme had toured with previously.
Production and release.
In September 2002, Josh Homme explained the band's goals with the release of the album:
In the same month, Nick Oliveri explained the band's aims in an interview with retail company HMV:
Between them, Homme and Oliveri had different opinions on the usage of fake radio excerpts between tracks on the album, the former believing it gave the album "fluidity". According to Oliveri, they are a jibe at "how a lot of stations play the same thing over and over. We don't get played on the radio, so I figure we should talk shit about them."
Several songs that appeared on the album were re-worked forms of tracks previously recorded and released in the Desert Sessions, a side project of Josh Homme with various guest collaborators. "You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire" was the opening track of ', with vocals originally performed by Mario Lalli instead of Oliveri. "Hangin' Tree" first appeared on '.
Also, both "A Song for the Deaf" and "Go with the Flow" were previously performed as early as 2001 with the former having very different lyrics and vocals completely by Mark Lanegan.
The album was initially planned for release on August 13, 2002, but was eventually postponed for two weeks.
Release and reception.

"Entertainment Weekly" called it "the year's best hard-rock album", giving it an A. "Splendid" said "the bottom line is that QOTSA turns in another genre-demolishing, hard-as-titanium album in "Songs for the Deaf". This is not your father's metal. It's better." "Mojo" listed the album as the year's third best, while Playlouder and "Spin" placed it at fourth. "NME" placed the album as the sixth best, with the three singles each making the magazine's "Tracks of the Year" list over the course of 2002/2003. "Kerrang!" rated the album at number 1 on its "Best albums of 2002" list.

Artwork.
The cover art for the U.S. double LP version of the album is quite different from the CD version, featuring a red Q (with a sperm cell as the line in the Q and an egg cell as the circle) on a black background with no other text. It was released on red vinyl. The UK vinyl version cover is the same as the CD cover. The dashboard/interior with superimposed logos is that of a Fiat 124 Sport Spider, a 1960sâ€“1980s mass market Italian sports car. The person on the album disc is musician Dave Catching, who performs on the album.
There were also three different album covers that were made for the CD version of "Songs for the Deaf". All of the interior artwork for each of the three versions is the same, but there were covers printed in red, magenta, and orange. The most common copy of the album sleeve is the red cover.
Track listing.
All tracks written by Joshua Homme and Nick Oliveri, except where noted. Lead vocals by Joshua Homme except where noted.
The Real Song for the Deaf.
"The Real Song for the Deaf", which is essentially Track 0, is located in the pregap of Track 1 as a hidden track. The hidden track can be found by rewinding the first track to roughly -1:33. A voice comes on and says: "Huh? What?" and a pattern of low-frequency bass plays and modulates for the rest of the song.
This track, as well as being omitted from some pressings of the album (see track listing), is difficult to listen to on all but conventional CD players. Most software CD players do not allow rewinding of this nature, and most MP3 "ripping" software will not include the data.
The iTunes Store includes this track as part of the entire album, with the US store including it as a separate track, and the UK store and Spotify including it as part of "You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire".
The track was not hidden on the album's cassette tape release, playing before "You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire".
